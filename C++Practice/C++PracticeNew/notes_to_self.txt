Hello Ian! Welcome back to your C++ journey! This is you from the past. I hope you get to meet Elon Musk sometime soon!

Notes:

1. To compile, write "g++" in the terminal, followed by a space, followed by the .cpp filename.
2. To run after compiling, write "./a.out" in the terminal.
3. Remember: references â‰  pointers!!!
4. A reference variable is a "reference" to an existing variable, and it is created with the & operator.
More info on references: https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/cpp_references.asp

Example:

string food = "Pizza";  // food variable
string &meal = food;    // reference to food variable
cout << food << "\n";  // Outputs Pizza
cout << meal << "\n";  // Outputs Pizza

5. To get the memory address of a variable, do the following: 
cout << &food; // Outputs 0x6dfed4, or some hexadecimal number resembling it
6. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.
7. A pointer variable points to a data type (like int or string) of the same type, and is created with the * operator. 
8. The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer.

Example: 

string* ptr = &food;    // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of food

// Output the value of food (Pizza)
cout << food << "\n";

// Output the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)
cout << &food << "\n";

// Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)
cout << ptr << "\n";
